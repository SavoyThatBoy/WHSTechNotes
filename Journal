Over winter break, I used technology mostly for live streaming and working on my side hustle. I spent time streaming online to connect with people and build my audience. I also used my phone and laptop to plan content, promote my work, and stay organized. Technology helped me stay productive while still enjoying my break.

Autcraft was created to give autistic children a safe and welcoming place to play Minecraft without bullying or harassment. Many online spaces can be unmoderated, which means people can be rude, harmful, or exclude others. Autcraft helps solve this problem by having clear rules, strong moderation, and a community focused on kindness. Safe online spaces are important because they help people feel comfortable being themselves. Developers should create these kinds of spaces because they have the tools to protect players, such as setting rules, adding reporting systems, and monitoring behavior. If developers ignore safety and inclusion, users can get hurt, feel unwelcome, or leave the community. Other examples of safe online spaces include moderated Discord servers and kid-friendly platforms like Roblox's restricted mode.

One way technology can help create fairness is by giving people a voice through social media and online platforms. This matters because many people, especially those who are ignored in real life, can speak up and share their experiences online. An example of this could be people using social media to record and share incidents of unfair treatment. This evidence shows that technology allows problems to be seen by more people instead of being ignored. When issues are shared online, it can lead to awareness, support, and sometimes real change. Because of this, technology helps hold people and systems accountable and makes society more just.
